This is my first blog post and I am very exited to write this!!! So, Here we go!!

This is about a pan india contest "Kronothon" in which I participated and was 4th runner up. It was a 2 Round Competitive programming contest that was hosted on Techgig.com . 

##1st Round(Online Preliminary Round)
This round was organised in my college itself on Techgig. I thought I will not be able to qualify 1st round but I have the habit of participating in every contest without bothering about it's result. I think by participating We will not lose anything but will gain a lot of Experience and Knowledge.

In the 1st round there was 1 coding Problem Statement(carrying 100 marks) and 20 Tech related MCQ's(Carrying total of 40 marks).

I managed to do the coding problem and was bit confused in some of MCQ's.But I managed to attempt all of them.After Completing the Exam, The Score card popped up and I was astonished by seeing my result. It was 126/140 (100/100 in coding problem).I never expected those figures.

A total of 100 participants were to be selected from 7000 students who participated in 1st round.Luckily,I was in Top 100.And Here my Journey begins for Kronothon Onsite Final Round. 

##Final Round(Onsite)
After getting selected in the first round ,I was in a dilemma weather to go or not as my Practical Exams were going on. But this time, College's Placement Commitee put their effort to help me out.They talked to Dean(Academics) and the problem was resolved. I got a leave for 5 days and the Practical Exams were resheduled for me. And the Journey continues!!
This round was held in Kronos India Pvt. Ltd. (Noida Center).I got free tickets by Kronos for Journey to Delhi. It was a 2 day event.

###1st Day(Main Event)
I was very much excited and this is the reason that I reached the venue 2 hours early!!One of there employee welcomed me and gave me the directions.No one arrived besides me until 1 hour.After waiting for few hours,Event was started.We were given our ID cards and a Amazon Gift Card of Rs.1000 .

It started by a warm welcome by Kronos India Pvt. Ltd. Office Chief. After that, The main event Onsite final round of **Kronothon** started.I was the only 1st year student there.There were students from various prestigious institutes like IIT's,NIT's and IIIT's. We were given two competitive programming problems which we have to complete in 2hrs. During the event we were also given refreshments. I was able to do 1st problem easily but was stucked in 2nd problem but I somehow manage to do it. But there were some corner cases which I was not able to figure out.I thought I was out of the contest as there were people saying they were able to crack both the problems.

###2nd Day(Result Declaration and Tech Talk on Big Data)
I just came for Tech Talk as I thought that I was already out of the game.The 2nd day started by some refreshments followed by the Tech talk on big data. Though I was not able to understand all the stuffs because at that time I didn't knew even a bit of it but the tech talk was really awesome.

Then the time came for announcement of result.I was not really excited because of the above given reason.The announcement starts from the 10th position.It continues until 6th position.Now,It was time for Top 5.Even the little bit of hope was now gone.**Then,The 4th runner was announced and it was me.I was totally shocked.I haven't imagined this even in my dreams.I was honoured with a medal and a cash prize of Rs.25k .**

Then,I introduced myself and everyone was shocked when I told them that I am a 1st year student.Then the Senior manager of Kronos India met me and he told that he is the alumni of the same college IIIT Bhubaneswar. Then I have a small chat with him.**Then the event concluded**.
